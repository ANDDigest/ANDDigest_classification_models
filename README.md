# ANDDigest_NN_Classifiers
This repository contains classification models, used for the [ANDDigest](https://anddigest.sysbio.ru/) project.

## Fine-Tuning Notebooks for the classification models
This **notebook** [![Open In Colab](images/colab.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb), used for the fine-tuning of the classification models for the binary classification of short biological entities for ANDDigest, was developed on the basis of the
_McCormick, Chris, and Nick Ryan. "Bert fine-tuning tutorial with pytorch." Retrieved January 24 (2019): 2021._ (tutorial)[https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/]

Please keep in mind, that in order to repeat a fine-tuning of the classification model, as it was done in the manuscript, the same dataset should be used, and valid pathes to the correspond files should be specified for the variables, located in the 4th cell.

All the used datasets are freely available, and can be downloaded in the datasets section via the following (images/huggingface.svg)[link](https://huggingface.co/Timofey). The models section contains all the fine-tuned models, that were used in ANDDigest.
