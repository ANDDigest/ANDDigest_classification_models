21432604	The aim of the present study was to investigate whether children with ADHD aged 8 to 10 years can rate their self-regulatory skills accurately when assessed with an age appropriate instrument.	ADHD	70 74	1	0
21432604	Twenty-seven children with ADHD and 27 matched normal control children completed the Self-rating Scale of Self-regulatory Function, a new rating scale that has been specifically designed for this age group.	ADHD	27 31	1	0
21432604	As expected, children with ADHD rated themselves significantly more dysfunctional than control children.	ADHD	27 31	1	0

26540567	CLL remains an incurable disease in spite of the many new compounds being studied.	CLL	0 3	1	0
26540567	Arsenic trioxide induces apoptosis in all CLL cell types and could constitute an efficient therapy.	CLL	42 45	1	0
26540567	To further explore this, we have studied the influence of stromal cells, key components of the CLL microenvironment, on the response of CLL cells to arsenic trioxide.	CLL	95 98	1	0
26540567	Bone marrow stromal cells induced CLL cell resistance to 2 muM arsenic trioxide and led to activation of Lyn, ERK, PI3K and PKC, as well as NF-kappaB and STAT3.	CLL	34 37	1	0
26540567	Mcl-1 was central to the mechanism of resistance to arsenic trioxide, since: 1) Mcl-1 levels correlated with the CLL cell response to arsenic trioxide, and 2) blocking Mcl-1 expression or function with specific siRNAs or inhibitors overcame the protecting effect of stroma.	CLL	113 116	1	0
26540567	We have therefore identified the mechanism involved in the CLL cell resistance to arsenic trioxide induced by bone marrow stroma and show that idelalisib or sotrastaurin block this mechanism and restore sensibility to arsenic trioxide.	CLL	59 62	1	0
26540567	Combination of arsenic trioxide with these inhibitors may thus constitute an efficient treatment for CLL.	CLL	101 104	1	0

26544772	OBJECT The authors compared the image quality and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 7.0-T and 3.0-T MRI and time-of-flight MR angiography in patients with moyamoya disease (MMD).	MMD	181 184	1	0
26544772	METHODS MR images of 15 patients with ischemic-type MMD (8 males, 7 females; age 13-48 years) and 13 healthy controls (7 males, 6 females; age 19-28 years) who underwent both 7.0-T and 3.0-T MRI and mr angiography were studied retrospectively.	MMD	52 55	1	0
26544772	Two diagnostic criteria for MMD were used: the T2 criteria, which used flow voids in the basal ganglion on T2-weighted images, and the time-of-flight criteria, which used the high-intensity areas in the basal ganglion on source images from time-of-flight mr angiography.	MMD	28 31	1	0
26544772	All data were evaluated by 2 independent readers who were blinded to the strength field and presence or absence of MMD.	MMD	115 118	1	0
26544772	Using conventional angiography as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of 7.0-T and 3.0-T MRI/mr angiography in the diagnosis of MMD were calculated.	MMD	143 146	1	0
26544772	Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that, according to the T2 criteria, 7.0-T MRI/mr angiography was more sensitive (sensitivity 1.000; specificity 0.933) than 3.0-T MRI/MRA (sensitivity 0.692; specificity 0.933) in diagnosing MMD;	MMD	247 250	1	0
26544772	The authors speculate that 7.0-T MRI/mr angiography is a promising technique in the diagnosis of MMD because it is noninvasive compared with conventional angiography and it is more sensitive than 3.0-T MRI/MRA.	MMD	97 100	1	0

26559840	Characterization of Recombinant Human Cytomegaloviruses Encoding IE1 Mutants L174P and 1-382 Reveals that Viral Targeting of PML Bodies Perturbs both Intrinsic and Innate Immune Responses.	PML	125 128	0	1
26559840	UNLABELLED: PML is the organizer of cellular structures termed nuclear domain 10 or PML-nuclear bodies that act as key mediators of intrinsic immunity against human cytomegalovirus and other viruses.	PML	12 15	0	1
26559840	IE1 interacts with PML through its globular core domain (IE1CORE) and induces nuclear domain 10 disruption in order to initiate lytic human cytomegalovirus infection.	PML	19 22	0	1
26559840	Here, we investigate the consequences of a point mutation (L174P) in IE1CORE, which was shown to abrogate the interaction with PML, for lytic human cytomegalovirus infection.	PML	127 130	0	1
26559840	In addition, our data provide evidence that IE1CORE as expressed by a recombinant human cytomegalovirus encoding IE1 1-382 not only is required to antagonize PML-mediated intrinsic immunity but also affects a recently described function of PML in innate immune signaling.	PML	240 243	0	1
26559840	We demonstrate a coregulatory role of PML in type I and type II interferon-induced gene expression and provide evidence that upregulation of interferon-induced genes is inhibited by IE1CORE.	PML	38 41	0	1
26559840	In conclusion, our data suggest that targeting PML by viral regulatory proteins represents a strategy to antagonize both intrinsic and innate immune mechanisms.	PML	47 50	0	1
26559840	IMPORTANCE: PML nuclear bodies, which represent nuclear multiprotein complexes consisting of PML and additional proteins, represent important cellular structures that mediate intrinsic resistance against many viruses, including human cytomegalovirus .	PML	93 96	0	1
26559840	During human cytomegalovirus infection, the major immediate early protein IE1 binds to PML via a central globular domain (IE1CORE), and we have shown previously that this is sufficient to antagonize intrinsic immunity.	PML	87 90	0	1
26559840	Here, we demonstrate that modification of PML by IE1CORE not only abrogates intrinsic defense mechanisms but also attenuates the interferon response during infection.	PML	42 45	0	1

26560846	Sometimes, however, a very wide variety of response rates was observed, which raises the question if this can be explained by individual expression levels of PD-L1 (CD 274) or PD-1 (PDCD1).Recently published data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) Network now provide a genome-wide data base that allows us to review or validate the molecular results obtained in clear cell renal cell carcinomas to date.In this study, we analysed the the cancer genome atlas KIRC mRNA expression data for PD-L1 and PD-1 for a possible association with clinical pathological parameters and the survival of 417 clear cell renal cell carcinomas patients.The mRNA expression of PD-L1 in primary nephrectomy specimens revealed no significant association with unfavourable clinical parameters.

26561249	We aimed to identify clinical and radiological features that might distinguish between congenital pulmonary airway malformation and PPB and to develop a diagnostic algorithm based on these features.	PPB	132 135	1	0
26561249	METHODS: All recorded cases of Type I PPB were retrieved from the International PPB Registry and compared with an institutional cohort of children undergoing resection of congenital pulmonary airway malformation (2002-2013) that was noted at some stage to be at least partially cystic.	PPB	38 41	1	0
26561249	Regression models were created to identify variables that might differentiate congenital pulmonary airway malformation from PPB.	PPB	124 127	1	0
26561249	RESULTS: In 112 cases of Type I PPB and 103 of congenital pulmonary airway malformation, factors favoring a diagnosis of congenital pulmonary airway malformation included prenatal detection (odds ratio 89.4), systemic feeding vessel (OR 61.7), asymptomatic (OR 8.0), and hyperinflated lung (OR 6.6).	PPB	32 35	1	0
26561249	Factors favoring a diagnosis of PPB included bilateral or multisegment involvement (odds ratio 2.4).	PPB	32 35	1	0

26561296	Disruption of posteromedial large-scale neural communication predicts recovery from coma.	coma	84 88	1	0
26561296	OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that the major consciousness deficit observed in coma is due to the breakdown of long-range neuronal communication supported by precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, and that prognosis depends on a specific connectivity pattern in these networks.	coma	75 79	1	0
26561296	We assessed patient outcome after 3 months using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised .	Coma	53 57	1	0
26561296	The functional connectivity strength between posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex was significantly different between comatose patients who went on to recover and those who eventually scored an unfavorable outcome 3 months after brain injury (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.001; linear regression between coma recovery scale-revised and PCC-medial prefrontal cortex activity coupling at rest, Spearman rho = 0.93, p < 0.003).	coma	320 324	1	0
26561296	CONCLUSION: In both etiology groups (traumatic and anoxic), changes in the connectivity of PCC-centered, spontaneously synchronized, large-scale networks account for the loss of external and internal self-centered awareness observed during coma.	coma	240 244	1	0

26562381	The challenge of objective scar colour assessment in a clinical setting: using digital photography.	scar	27 31	1	0
26562381	OBJECTIVE: Scar assessment in the clinical setting is typically impeded by a lack of quantitative data and most systems rely on subjective rating scales which are user dependant and show considerable variability between raters.	Scar	11 15	1	0
26562381	The growing use of digital photography in medicine suggests a more objective approach to scar evaluation.	scar	89 93	1	0

26562668	METHODS AND FINDINGS: To explore the mechanisms that are intrinsic to the pathogens themselves ("intrinsic factors") for epidemic cycling, we consider a multi-strain SIRS model including cross-immunity and infectivity enhancement and use seasonal influenza as an example to parameterize the model.	SIRS	166 170	0	1
26562668	The Kullback-Leibler information distance was calculated to measure the match between the model outputs and the typical features of seasonal flu (an outbreak duration of 11 weeks and an annual attack rate of 15%).	flu	141 144	1	0
26562668	Alternative modelling that also includes seasonal forcing in transmissibility shows that both external mechanisms (i.e. seasonal forcing) and the intrinsic mechanisms (i.e., strain interactions) are equally able to generate the observed time-series in seasonal flu.	flu	261 264	1	0
26562668	CONCLUSIONS: The intrinsic mechanism of strain interactions alone can generate the observed patterns of seasonal flu epidemics, but according to Kullback-Leibler information distance the importance of extrinsic mechanisms cannot be excluded.	flu	113 116	1	0

21253569	Here we use 38 different measures of allele frequency variation and 8 iHS scores to characterize over 1,300 genome-wide association studies SNPs in 53 globally distributed human populations.	iHS	70 73	0	1
21253569	We find that groups of SNPs associated with pigmentation, blood pressure, infectious disease, and autoimmune disease traits exhibit unusual allele frequency patterns and elevated iHS scores in certain geographical locations.	iHS	179 182	0	1
21253569	We also find that genome-wide association studies SNPs have generally elevated scores for measures of allele frequency variation and for iHS in Eurasia and East Asia.	iHS	137 140	0	1
21253569	Overall, we believe that our results provide evidence for selection on several complex traits that has caused changes in allele frequencies and/or elevated iHS scores at a number of associated loci.	iHS	156 159	0	1
21253569	Since genome-wide association studies SNPs collectively exhibit elevated allele frequency measures and iHS scores, selection on complex traits may be quite widespread.	iHS	103 106	0	1

21253801	Basal serum cortisol levels were similar in patients and controls, but increased levels of proinflammatory cytokine and noradrenalin were seen in SSc patients.	SSc	146 149	1	0
21253801	Characteristically, contrary to the control group, whose cortisol levels increased significantly following the mental calculation stress test, no significant increase was observed in the patients when post-test cortisol levels were compared to pre-test levels, suggesting a defect in the normal cortisol response upon stress in SSc patients.	SSc	328 331	1	0
21253801	The present results suggest that there may be impaired function of the neuro-endocrine-immune system upon stress in SSc patients.	SSc	116 119	1	0

21255973	Despite increased interest in the role of effortful control in developmental disorders, few studies have focused on effortful control in autism spectrum disorders and no study so far has directly compared children with autism spectrum disorders and children with ADHD.	ADHD	263 267	1	0
21255973	A first aim of this study was to investigate whether typically developing boys, boys with ADHD and boys with autism spectrum disorders can be differentiated based on effortful control levels.	ADHD	90 94	1	0
21255973	A second aim was to evaluate the relationship between effortful control and symptoms of ADHD and autism spectrum disorders.	ADHD	88 92	1	0
21255973	We assessed effortful control in 27 typically developing boys, 27 boys with ADHD and 27 boys with autism spectrum disorders (age 10-15) using different effortful control questionnaires.	ADHD	76 80	1	0
21255973	Our data suggest that although effortful control is useful in differentiating typically developing boys from clinical groups, it is less efficient in distinguishing ADHD from autism spectrum disorders.	ADHD	165 169	1	0
21255973	Also, results suggest that effortful control plays a role in the manifestation of symptoms of both ADHD and autism spectrum disorders and that high levels of effortful control enable children to function more adequate in daily situations.	ADHD	99 103	1	0

21258037	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Because previous studies have not distinguished between intimal (atherosclerotic) and medial vascular calcification, the prevalence and clinical significance of either condition in chronic or end-stage kidney disease (CKD or ESKD) are unknown.	CKD	245 248	1	0
21258037	We hypothesized that breast arterial calcification is exclusively medial and that mammography can serve as a useful marker of generalized medial calcification in CKD and ESKD.	CKD	162 165	1	0
21258037	DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Arterial calcification was identified histologically in breast tissue or visually in mammograms and radiographs of extremities from patients with CKD or ESKD.	CKD	193 196	1	0

26937183	PURPOSE: This systematic review aimed to identify the most effective components of interventions to facilitate self-management of health care behaviors for patients with COPD.	COPD	170 174	1	0
26937185	COPD is now widely recognized as a complex heterogeneous syndrome, having both pulmonary and extrapulmonary features.	COPD	0 4	1	0
26937185	In clinical practice, the diagnosis of COPD is based on the presence of chronic airflow limitation, as assessed by post-bronchodilator spirometry.	COPD	39 43	1	0
26937185	However, in order to accurately assess the complexity of COPD, there need to be other measures made beyond FEV1.	COPD	57 61	1	0
26937185	At present, there is a lack of reliable and simple blood biomarkers to confirm and further assess the diagnosis of COPD.	COPD	115 119	1	0
26937185	However, it is possible to identify patients who display different phenotypic characteristics of COPD that relate to clinically relevant outcomes.	COPD	97 101	1	0
26937185	Currently, validated phenotypes of COPD include alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and "frequent exacerbators".	COPD	35 39	1	0
26937185	Recently, a definition and assessment of a new phenotype comprising patients with overlapping features of asthma and COPD has been suggested and is known as "asthma COPD overlap syndrome".	COPD	117 121	1	0

26938966	BACKGROUND: Although alcohol misuse co-occurs with PTSD symptoms at a strikingly high rate (i.e., nearly 52% of men and 28% of women with PTSD also meet diagnostic criteria for an Alcohol Use Disorder), the functional associations between these symptom types remain unclear.	PTSD	51 55	1	0
26938966	BACKGROUND: Although alcohol misuse co-occurs with PTSD symptoms at a strikingly high rate (i.e., nearly 52% of men and 28% of women with PTSD also meet diagnostic criteria for an Alcohol Use Disorder), the functional associations between these symptom types remain unclear.	PTSD	138 142	1	0
26938966	This study builds on the existing literature, as most prior research has been limited to cross-sectional studies and has not explored prospective relations between specific PTSD symptom clusters and alcohol misuse.	PTSD	173 177	1	0
26938966	RESULTS: Consistent with the self-medication model, results indicated that PTSD symptoms demonstrate a prospective and proximal association with alcohol misuse during the assessment period;	PTSD	75 79	1	0
26938966	However, alcohol misuse did not appear to be a unique contributor to overall PTSD symptom exacerbation over time.	PTSD	77 81	1	0
26938966	Examination of individual PTSD symptom clusters revealed that more severe symptoms of intrusion and numbing, but not avoidance and hyperarousal, predicted greater alcohol misuse at subsequent time intervals.	PTSD	26 30	1	0
26938966	Diagnostic criteria for PTSD and/or Alcohol Use Disorders were not assessed.	PTSD	24 28	1	0
26938966	Future work may benefit from replicating these findings in clinical populations formally diagnosed with PTSD via clinician-administered structured interviews.	PTSD	104 108	1	0

26866719	Logistic regression was used to examine the association between age, sex, body mass index, disease duration, cardiovascular comorbidities, tophi, serum uric acid, and >2 acute attacks of gout in the previous 12 months.	gout	187 191	1	0
26866719	Receiver operating curves were plotted to examine their ability in identifying patients with recurrent gout attacks.	gout	103 107	1	0
26866719	Disease duration and serum uric acid associated independently with >2 acute attacks of gout in the previous 12 months (adjusted odds ratio 1.36 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.08-1.72] and 1.27 [95% CI 1.10-1.46], respectively).	gout	87 91	1	0
26866719	However, these factors performed poorly in identifying patients with frequent gout attacks, with an area under the curve of 0.61, and there was an insignificant increase in area under the curve on adding other variables (area under the curve 0.64).	gout	78 82	1	0

26875085	CASE PRESENTATION: Twelve blood biomarkers were used for monitoring a case of OSCC suffering from precancerous oral lichen ruber planus mucosae (OLP).	OSCC	78 82	1	0
26875085	After curative R0 tumor resection of primary OSCC (buccal mucosa), elevated epitope detection in monocytes -Apo10, EDIM-transketolase-like-1 (TKTL1), squamous cell carcinoma antigen, total serum lactate dehydrogenase, and its anaerobic isoforms (LDH-4, LDH-5) decreased to normal levels.

26882540	China reported 9 million cases of HFMD between 2008 and 2013, with the two serotypes Enterovirus A71 and Coxsackievirus A16 being responsible for the majority of these cases.	HFMD	34 38	1	0
26882540	Three recent phase 3 clinical trials showed that inactivated monovalent enterovirus a71 vaccines manufactured in China were highly efficacious against HFMD associated with enterovirus a71, but offered no protection against HFMD caused by coxsackievirus a16.	HFMD	151 155	1	0
26882540	Three recent phase 3 clinical trials showed that inactivated monovalent enterovirus a71 vaccines manufactured in China were highly efficacious against HFMD associated with enterovirus a71, but offered no protection against HFMD caused by coxsackievirus a16.	HFMD	223 227	1	0
26882540	To better inform vaccination policy, we used mathematical models to evaluate the effect of prospective vaccination against EV-A71-associated HFMD and the potential risk of serotype replacement by coxsackievirus a16.	HFMD	141 145	1	0
26882540	METHODS AND FINDINGS: Weekly reports of HFMD incidence from 31 provinces in Mainland China from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013 were used to fit multi-serotype time series susceptible-infected-recovered (TSIR) epidemic models.	HFMD	40 44	1	0
26882540	Achieving high coverage rates of enterovirus a71 vaccination would be necessary to eliminate the ongoing transmission of enterovirus a71, but serotype replacement by coxsackievirus a16 following enterovirus a71 vaccination is likely to be transient and minor compared to the corresponding reduction in the burden of EV-A71-associated HFMD.	HFMD	334 338	1	0

21120508	Cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 in circulating lymphomonocytes of ALS patients with and without TARDBP mutations.	ALS	69 72	1	0
21120508	In recent years, TDP-43 has been identified as the major pathological protein in ALS due to its mislocalisation in the cytoplasm of motor neurons of patients with and without TARDBP mutations and expression in forms that do not match its predicted molecular weight.	ALS	81 84	1	0
21120508	In this study, the TDP-43 profile was investigated using western immunoblot analysis in whole lysates, nuclei and cytoplasm of circulating lymphomonocytes from 16 ALS patients, 4 with (ALS/TDP+) and 12 without (ALS/TDP-) TARDBP mutations in the protein C-terminal domain, and thirteen age-matched, healthy donors (controls).	ALS	163 166	1	0
21120508	In all ALS patients, relatives and controls, TDP-43 retained the predicted molecular weight in whole cell lysates and nuclei, but in the cytoplasm its molecular weight was slightly smaller than expected.	ALS	7 10	1	0
21120508	In quantitative terms, TDP-43 was expressed at approximately the same levels in whole cell lysates of ALS patients, relatives and controls.	ALS	102 105	1	0

21120673	Forty-eight adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and 29 SS with apical vertebrae located between T7 and T9 were recruited.	SS	51 53	1	0
21120673	At the levels of the apical vertebrae, the vertebrae above and below the apex, the mean discrepancy in rib length (concave minus convex rib) was 7, 4 and 7 mm, respectively, in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis group (p < 0.01), and 6, 5 and 7 mm in SS group, respectively (p < 0.01).	SS	248 250	1	0
21120673	The rib length discrepancy between concave and convex sides was significantly correlated with the magnitude of the Cobb angle of thoracic curve in both adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and SS groups (p < 0.01).	SS	188 190	1	0
21120673	Similar findings of the asymmetry of rib length in both adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and SS patients pointed strongly to the fact that the rib length asymmetry in apical region is most likely secondary to the scoliosis deformity rather than playing a primary role in the etiopathogenesis.

21120954	SMN2 exon 7 splicing is inhibited by binding of hnRNP A1 to a common ESS motif that spans the 3' splice site.	ESS	69 72	0	1
21120954	We previously reported high similarity between the sequence spanning the 3' ss of SMN1 and SMN2 exon 7 and an hnRNP A1 binding ESS, which regulates MCAD exon 5 splicing.	ESS	127 130	0	1
21120954	We show here that this 3' ss motif indeed functions as a crucial hnRNP A1 binding ESS, which inhibits inclusion of SMN1/2 exon 7 and is antagonized by the SMN1 ESE, but not by the inactive SMN2 sequence.	ESS	82 85	0	1
21120954	Genomic analyses revealed that in the human genome, 3' ss matching the SMN1/2 ESS motif region are much less abundant than 3' ss with a disrupted ESS motif.	ESS	78 81	0	1

21127171	In contrast, little is known about the genetic basis for the evolution of aerobic fermentation in the Sch. pombe lineage.	Sch	102 105	1	0
21127171	In particular, it is not known whether respiration-related genes in Sch. pombe have undergone a transcriptional reprogramming or changes in nucleosome occupancy pattern in their promoter regions.	Sch	68 71	1	0
21127171	In this study, we compared genome-wide gene expression profiles of Sch. pombe with those of S. cerevisiae and the aerobic respiration yeast Candida albicans.	Sch	67 70	1	0
21127171	We found that the expression profile of respiration-related genes in Sch. pombe is similar to that of S. cerevisiae, but different from that of C. albicans, suggesting that their transcriptional regulation has been reprogrammed during the evolution of aerobic fermentation.	Sch	69 72	1	0

21127888	Three hundred and forty-three patients (35-90 years of age) with initial diagnosis of coronary artery disease were separated into two groups: 165 patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease (SVD group) and 178 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (MVD group).	MVD	269 272	1	0
21127888	An adjusted multivariate analysis showed that only chronic kidney disease was associated with MVD (odds ratio, 2.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.76-4.63; P = 0.00002).	MVD	94 97	1	0
21127888	The risk of major adverse cardiac event was approximately threefold higher in the group with MVD and chronic kidney disease stage of 3 or greater than in the group with SVD but without chronic kidney disease stage of 3 or greater (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-9.17; P = 0.016).	MVD	93 96	1	0
21127888	A statistical analysis also suggested that having MVD and advanced chronic kidney disease was a more powerful risk factor for major adverse cardiac event.	MVD	50 53	1	0

21134273	RESULTS: We show for the first time that protein phosphatase 2a mRNA and protein expression are significantly reduced in SSc fibroblasts and correlate with an increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and collagen expression.	SSc	121 124	1	0
21134273	Accordingly, blockade of autocrine transforming growth factor beta signaling in SSc fibroblasts using soluble recombinant transforming growth factor beta receptor II (SRII) restored protein phosphatase 2a levels and decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and collagen expression.	SSc	80 83	1	0
21134273	In addition, we observed that inhibition of ERK1/2 in SSc fibroblasts increased protein phosphatase 2a expression suggesting that ERK1/2 phosphorylation also contributes to maintaining low levels of protein phosphatase 2a, leading to an even further amplification of ERK1/2 phosphorylation.	SSc	54 57	1	0
21134273	CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these studies suggest that decreased protein phosphatase 2a levels in SSc is a result of constitutively activated autocrine transforming growth factor beta signaling and could contribute to enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and matrix production in SSc fibroblasts.	SSc	99 102	1	0

21555177	BACKGROUND: The scientific evidence of a beneficial effect of ALS in pre-hospital treatment in trauma patients or patients with any acute illness is scarce.	ALS	62 65	0	1
21555177	The objective of this systematic review of controlled studies was to examine whether ALS, as opposed to BLS, increases patient survival in pre-hospital treatment and if so, to identify the patient groups that gain benefit.	ALS	85 88	0	1
21555177	Controlled studies comparing survival after the pre-hospital ALS treatment versus BLS treatment in trauma patients or patients with cardiac arrest were included.	ALS	61 64	0	1
21555177	In nine of 18 studies including 16,857 trauma patients in the intervention group, ALS care did not increase survival compared to BLS treatment (pooled OR 0.892, 95% CI, 0.775-1.026).	ALS	82 85	0	1
21555177	In nine of 18 studies including 7659 patients with cardiac arrest in the intervention group, ALS care increased survival compared to BLS treatment (OR 1.468, 95% CI, 1.257-1.715).	ALS	93 96	0	1
21555177	Most subgroup analyses revealed no significant interactions, but data from six trials, where ALS was provided by physicians, increases the probability of survival at hospital discharge even more (OR 2.047, 95% CI 1.593-2.631).	ALS	93 96	0	1

21565967	Noninvasive ventilation in COPD: impact of inspiratory pressure levels on sleep quality.	COPD	27 31	1	0
21565967	BACKGROUND: Although high-intensity noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is superior to low-intensity noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in controlling nocturnal hypoventilation in stable hypercapnic patients with COPD, it produces higher amounts of air leakage, which, in turn, could impair sleep quality.	COPD	226 230	1	0
21565967	CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COPD, high inspiratory pressures used with long-term high-intensity noninvasive positive pressure ventilation produce acceptable sleep quality that is no worse than that produced by lower inspiratory pressures, which are more traditionally applied in conjunction with low-intensity noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.

27068678	To investigate the crosstalk between RUNX2 and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha,25-(OH)2D3) in human dental follicle cells during osteoclast formation, we established a co-culture system of human dental follicle cells from CCD patient and healthy donors with peripheral blood mononuclear cells .	CCD	228 231	1	0
27068678	Expression of the osteoclast-associated genes and the number of TRAP(+) cells were reduced in CCD human dental follicle cells, indicating its suppressed osteoclast-inductive ability, which was reflected by the downregulated RANKL/OPG ratio.	CCD	94 97	1	0
27068678	Conversely, RUNX2 mutation abolished this 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3-induced RANKL gene activation and osteoclast formation in CCD human dental follicle cells.	CCD	118 121	1	0

Arc	138 141	0	1
27255708	The CFC-induced upregulation of Arc and c-fos in 10Gy-irradiated hippocampi was significantly lower than that in sham-irradiated controls, although there were no significant differences in the protein levels of the learning-induced zif268 between sham-irradiated and 10Gy-irradiated hippocampi.	Arc	32 35	0	1
27255708	Thus, cranial irradiation with 10Gy of gamma-ray impairs the induction of hippocampal immediate-early genes (particularly Arc and c-fos) via behavioral contextual fear memory, and this disturbance may be associated with the memory deficits evident in mice after cranial irradiation, possibly through the dysregulation of neuronal plasticity during memory formation.

27256185	Resection speed, reduction in hemoglobin (deltaHb) and hematocrit (deltaHCT) levels, incidence of urethral mucosa rupture, re-catheterization and continuous infection had significant correlation with urethral stricture, while PSA level, storage score, total prostate volume, transitional zone volume, transitional zone index, resection time and resected gland weight had significant correlation with BNC.	BNC	400 403	1	0
27256185	Lower resection speed (OR=0.48), urethral mucosa rupture (OR=2.44) and continuous infection (OR=1.49) as well as higher storage score (OR=2.51) and lower total prostate volume (OR=0.15) were found to be the independent risk factors of urethral stricture and BNC respectively.	BNC	258 261	1	0
27256185	CONCLUSIONS: Lower resection speed, intraoperative urethral mucosa rupture and postoperative continuous infection were associated with a higher risk of urethral stricture while severer storage phase symptom and smaller prostate size were associated with a higher risk of BNC after transurethral resection of prostate.

27275130	The mechanisms of electron capture and electron transfer dissociation (ECD and ETD) are investigated by covalently attaching a free-radical hydrogen atom scavenger to a peptide.	ECD	71 74	0	1
27275130	However, ECD of the TEMPO labeled peptide dication yielded no backbone cleavage.	ECD	9 12	0	1
27275130	In summary, the results indicate that ECD and ETD backbone cleavage processes are inhibited by scavenging of a labile hydrogen atom by the localized TEMPO radical moiety.	ECD	38 41	0	1
27275130	This observation supports the conjecture that ECD and ETD processes involve long-lived intermediates formed by electron capture/transfer in which a labile hydrogen atom is present and plays a key role with low energy processes leading to c and z ion formation.	ECD	46 49	0	1

19903356	To test this hypothesis, we manipulated insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 levels in two imatinib-responsive GIST cell lines and observed cell viability after drug treatment.	GIST	119 123	1	0
19903356	Furthermore, both the loss of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 in GIST882 cells and the overexpression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 in GIST-T1 cells was cytotoxic, demonstrating that insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 has opposing effects on GIST cell viability.	GIST	283 287	1	0
19903356	CONCLUSION: This data demonstrates that insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 has dual, opposing roles in modulating GIST cell viability and response to imatinib in vitro.	GIST	124 128	1	0
19903356	These preliminary findings suggest that there may be some clinical benefits to insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 therapy in GIST patients, but further studies are needed to better characterize the functions of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 in GIST.

19909533	B-cell follicles are present in lung tissue and increased anti-elastin titers have been found in plasma of COPD patients.	COPD	107 111	1	0
19909533	We hypothesize that the specific immune response in COPD is smoke induced, either by a direct effect of smoking or as a result of smoke-induced lung tissue destruction (i.e. formation of neo-epitopes or auto antigens).	COPD	52 56	1	0
19909533	Furthermore, we propose that Tregs are involved in the suppression of this smoke-induced specific immune response.The presence of B cells, memory B cells and Tregs was assessed by flow cytometry in peripheral blood of 20 COPD patients and 29 healthy individuals and related to their current smoking status.COPD patients had lower (memory) B-cell percentages and higher Treg percentages in peripheral blood than healthy individuals, with a significant negative correlation between these cells.

19913652	Virtually no neurologist nor psychiatrist today can be unaware of the diagnosis of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS).	GTS	115 118	1	0
19913652	In this article, the two most renown accounts of exceptional individuals retrospectively diagnosed with GTS are critically analyzed: British lexicographer Samuel Johnson and Austrian musician Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.	GTS	104 107	1	0
19913652	The case for Samuel Johnson having GTS is strong, mainly based on Boswell's extensive biographical account.	GTS	35 38	1	0
19913652	Johnson was reported to have a great range of tics and compulsions, including involuntary utterances, repetitive ejaculations, and echo-phenomena.	tics	46 50	1	0
19913652	However, the evidence supporting the core features of GTS, i.e., motor and vocal tics, is rather inconsistent.	GTS	54 57	1	0

19913658	While there apparently is an etiological relationship between GTS and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, it appears that the common form of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder does not share genetic factors with GTS.	GTS	224 227	1	0

19915508	PURPOSE: The aim was to identify additional noninvasive tools allowing to detect and to quantify the metabolic impairment in patients with mitochondrial myopathies or McArdle's disease (McA).	McA	186 189	1	0
19915508	METHODS: Kinetics of adjustment of pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO2 kinetics) during transitions to constant-load moderate-intensity cycle ergometer exercise were determined on 15 mitochondrial myopathies, 8 McA, 21 patients with signs and/or symptoms of metabolic myopathy but a negative biopsy ("patient controls"; P-CTRL), and 22 healthy untrained controls .	McA	204 207	1	0
19915508	RESULTS: VO2 kinetics were slower in mitochondrial myopathies and in McA versus P-controls and controls, slower in McA versus mitochondrial myopathies, and not significantly different between P-CTRL and controls.	McA	69 72	1	0
19915508	RESULTS: VO2 kinetics were slower in mitochondrial myopathies and in McA versus P-controls and controls, slower in McA versus mitochondrial myopathies, and not significantly different between P-CTRL and controls.	McA	115 118	1	0
19915508	The time constants (tau) of the monoexponential function describing the VO2 kinetics were (X +/- SE) 59.2 +/- 8.5 s in mitochondrial myopathies, 87.6 +/- 16.4 s in McA, 36.9 +/- 3.1 s in P-CTRL, and 35.4 +/- 1.9 s in controls.	McA	164 167	1	0

19915868	All three MAOA single-nucleotide polymorphisms were significantly associated with gout.	gout	82 86	1	0
19915868	A synonymous MAOA SNP, rs1137070 Asp470Asp, located in exon 14, was associated with the risk of having gout (P = 4.0 x 10(-5), adjusted odds ratio 1.46, 95% confidence intervals : 1.11-1.91).	gout	103 107	1	0
19915868	We also showed that, when compared to individuals with the MAOA GAT haplotype, carriers of the AGC haplotype had a 1.67-fold (95% confidence intervals: 1.28-2.17) higher risk of gout.	gout	178 182	1	0
19915868	Moreover, we found that MAOA enzyme activity correlated positively with hyperuricemia and gout (P for trend = 2.00 x 10(-3) vs. normal control).	gout	90 94	1	0
19915868	We also found that MAOA enzyme activity by rs1137070 allele was associated with hyperuricemia and gout (P for trend = 1.53 x 10(-6) vs. wild-type allele).	gout	98 102	1	0
19915868	Thus, our results show that some MAOA alleles, which have a higher enzyme activity, predispose to the development of gout.	gout	117 121	1	0

3754262	The purpose of the present study was to determine if either natural killing cells or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity might play a role in the development of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HD) by testing the ability of killer cells to cause lysis of K562 erythroleukemia tumor cells and human thyrocytes in the presence and absence of serum from normal and HD patients.	HD	364 366	1	0

20359942	METHODS: We have used microneurography to evaluate possible electrophysiological interactions in 24 patients diagnosed with CRPS I (n=13), or CRPS II (n=11) by simultaneously recording from single identified sympathetic efferent fibers and C nociceptors, while provoking sympathetic neural discharges in cutaneous nerves.	CRPS	124 128	1	0
20359942	RESULTS: We assessed potential effects of sympathetic activity upon 35 polymodal nociceptors and 19 mechano-insensitive nociceptors, recorded in CRPS I (26 nociceptors) and CRPS II patients (28 nociceptors).	CRPS	145 149	1	0
20359942	CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that activation of nociceptors by sympathetic efferent discharges is not a cardinal pathogenic event in either CRPS I or CRPS II patients.	CRPS	136 140	1	0

20360591	We previously demonstrated CHX causes a fetal inflammatory response syndrome .	CHX	27 30	1	0
20360591	Herein, we test the hypothesis that CHX may cause fetal brain injury by upregulating inflammatory cytokine cascades, culminating in apoptosis pathway activation.	CHX	36 39	1	0
20360591	Based on a microarray spotted with 113 cytokines and receptors, 22 genes were upregulated by CHX in proportion to the degree of hypoxia;	CHX	93 96	1	0
20360591	Thus, CHX triggers fetal brain inflammation inversely proportional to its severity characterized by increased apoptosis and neuronal loss.	CHX	6 9	1	0
20360591	We suggest CHX fetal brain injury is not directly caused by oxygen deprivation but rather is an adaptive response that becomes maladaptive.	CHX	11 14	1	0

31135601	We have previously reported increased glucose transporter 1 expression in melanoma compared to benign nevi, associated with a significantly lower survival rate.	nevi	102 106	1	0
31135601	Glucose transporter 1 upregulation was highly specific for distinguishing melanoma from benign nevi, yet poorly sensitive, likely because of expression of other GLUT isoforms.	nevi	95 99	1	0
31135601	A tissue microarray, consisting of 91 primary melanomas, 18 melanoma metastases, and 56 nevi, was examined using GLUT2 and GLUT3 immunohistochemistry.	nevi	88 92	1	0
31135601	GLUT2 was negative in all melanomas and benign nevi examined.	nevi	47 51	1	0
31135601	Increased GLUT3 expression was more frequent in melanoma than in nevi (P < 0.0001), and in metastatic melanoma than in primary melanomas (P < 0.001).	nevi	65 69	1	0
31135601	GLUT3 expression was upregulated in melanoma compared with nevi, especially in those with worse prognosis.	nevi	59 63	1	0
31135866	As a result, much effort has been and continues to be expended in developing and refining effective diagnostic algorithms to help identify melanomas and differentiate them from nevi, such as the ABCDE rule (A for asymmetry, B for border irregularity, C for color variegation, D for diameter >6 mm, and E for evolution in lesion size, shape, or color).	nevi	177 181	1	0
31135866	The discipline of dermoscopy has improved the detection of melanoma and other skin cancers, has resulted in the detection of thinner melanomas, and has helped improve the ability to differentiate nevi (benign lesions) from melanomas, which, in turn, has resulted in fewer biopsies of benign lesions.	nevi	196 200	1	0

15176292	Nitric oxide was measured in exhaled air by means of chemiluminescence (model 280 nitric oxide analyzer. Sievers Instruments, Inc, USA. Healthy, nonsmoking subjects had exhaled nitric oxide levels of 10-20 ppB and smoking was one of the factors reduces exhaled nitric oxide. Exhaled nitric oxide was elevated in asthma patients. The patients with stable COPD have been shown to have exhaled nitric oxide on the same level that healthy smoking subjects. We observed, that the study patients with pollinosis who did not have asthma symptoms had increased levels of exhaled nitric oxide during pollen season. Measurement of exhaled nitric oxide is an easy, non-invasive procedure that can be used to monitor the level of airway inflammation.	COPD	354 358	1	0
