NPC	66 69	0	1
215529	Apart from these variations, and regardless of geographical or ethnic origins, NPC was consistently found to be associated with an active infection (or reactivation) by Epstein-Barr virus, which was not the case for patients with other tumours or for normal individuals from the same areas or of the same ethnic groups.

1083809	The uptake of 5-hydroxytryptophan (3H-5-HTP) and serotonin (3H-5-HT) and their distribution have been demonstrated, at the ultrastructural level, in the secretory rudimentary photoreceptor cells (SRP cells), in the pineal organ of the parakeet and the duck.	SRP	196 199	0	1
1083809	When the parakeets were injected with 3H-5-HTP alone or pretreated with drugs interfering with monoamine metabolism (e.g. R04-4602, nialamide) prior to injection of the label, the SRP cells always exhibited specific radioautographic reactions, in the regions of the dense secretory granules of the cell body and asynaptic pedicles.	SRP	180 183	0	1
1083809	From these results it is suggested that the uptake of precursors in some compartments of SRP cells is qualitatively independent of: a) the experimental period (experiments performed in winter, spring, and summer; uptake of precursors between 11.00 a.m. and 12.00) b) the precursor (3H-5-HTP or 3H-5-HT) c) the observation times.

1357078	The TAP13 pili were immunologically different from A. sobria Ae1 pili and A. hydrophila Ae6 W pili as previously reported, nevertheless all three had indistinguishable morphology and shared a high degree of homology in their N-terminal amino acid sequences.	pili	10 14	1	0

1358769	Inhibition by tiazofurin of inosine 5'-phosphate dehydrogenase (IMP DH) activity in extracts of ovarian carcinomas.	IMP	64 67	0	1
1358769	Cancer cells have an increased ability to synthesize guanosine triphosphate because of increased activity of IMP DH (inosine 5'-phosphate dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.205).	IMP	109 112	0	1
1358769	Because IMP DH activity is rate limiting for de novo biosynthesis of guanosine triphosphate, this enzyme was suggested as a sensitive target for chemotherapy.	IMP	8 11	0	1
1358769	Tiazofurin (2-beta-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide) is converted in the cells into the active metabolite, tiazofurin, (thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide) which potently inhibits IMP DH activity.	IMP	194 197	0	1
1358769	By adding tiazofurin to tissue extracts one can determine the extent of inhibition of IMP DH.	IMP	86 89	0	1
1358769	We applied the IMP DH assay method to extracts of normal ovaries (N = 11) and epithelial ovarian carcinomas (N = 10).	IMP	15 18	0	1
1358769	The IMP DH activity (mean +/- SE) in ovarian carcinoma was 21.1 +/- 5.8 which was markedly higher than that observed in normal ovaries (2.9 +/- 0.7 nmol/hr/mg protein) (P < 0.05%).	IMP	4 7	0	1
1358769	The inhibition by tiazofurin of IMP DH activity in ovarian carcinomas (N = 4) was 81%.	IMP	32 35	0	1
1358769	The results indicate that IMP DH activity is elevated sevenfold in ovarian carcinomas as compared to normal ovary and can be inhibited by exposure to tiazofurin .	IMP	26 29	0	1
1358769	Similar high IMP DH activity and inhibition of the activity by tiazofurin was observed in patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis among whom 70 to 80% remissions were reported.	IMP	13 16	0	1
1358769	Since there is increased IMP DH activity in human ovarian carcinomas and in OVCAR-5 cells and tiazofurin and tiazofurin inhibit IMP DH activity of these cells and the proliferation of human ovarian carcinoma xenografts in the mouse, tiazofurin may merit serious consideration for a Phase II trial for patients with recurrent/refractory epithelial ovarian carcinoma.

1359693	Although antibody titres measured against purified pili by ELISA were highest with homologous serogroup antigens, cross-reactive titres to shared epitopes of M. bovis pili were also detected by this method.	pili	51 55	1	0
1359693	The present findings, together with other evidence indicating that immunity to infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis is serogroup-specific, suggest that inclusion of pili from one representative strain from each of the seven Australian and British serogroups in a polyvalent, subunit vaccine should effectively protect the majority of cattle against infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis caused by most field strains of M. bovis encountered in Australia and the United Kingdom.	pili	167 171	1	0

1361583	The structure of the P pili from Escherichia coli has been studied using X-ray fiber diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy .	pili	23 27	1	0
1361583	Analysis of the fiber diffraction data indicates that the pili are constituted largely of structural subunits arranged helically with approximately 33 subunits in 10 turns in an axial repeat of 244.5 +/- 1.8 A.	pili	58 62	1	0
1361583	Radial electron density distributions calculated from equatorial diffraction data and scanning transmission electron microscopy data indicate that the pili are about 65 A in diameter with a small central cavity roughly 15 A across.	pili	151 155	1	0
1361583	The principal protein component of the pili is PapA, which has a molecular weight of 16.5 kDa.	pili	39 43	1	0

1361583	Scanning transmission electron microscopy images demonstrated the presence of thin, thread-like structures emerging from the ends of pili and spanning breaks in the pili structure.	pili	133 137	1	0
1361583	These data are consistent with the fibrillae representing an unwound or unraveled form of the pili proteins overstretched to about five times the length they would have in the intact pili.	pili	94 98	1	0
1361757	Furthermore, recent experiments indicate that the receptor phosphotyrosine phosphatase, CD45, might be important in the regulation of p56lck protein tyrosine kinase activity and that its expression is required for the generation of second messenger molecules following TCR triggering.

1361937	Pili were observed in three of 54 (6%) of strains isolated from blood, 30 of 40 (75%) of those recovered from abscesses (P < 0.001), and 49 of 71 (69%) of those found in normal flora (P < 0.001).	Pili	0 4	1	0
1361937	In contrast, the presence of pili in Bacteroides spp. recovered mostly from abscesses and normal flora suggests that this structure may play a role in the ability of these organisms to adhere to mucous membranes and may interfere with their ability to spread systemically.	pili	29 33	1	0

1362447	Pili confer the initial ability of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to bind to epithelial cells.	Pili	0 4	1	0
1362447	We demonstrate here that at least two different adherence properties are associated with the gonococcal pili: one is specific for erythrocytes, which is virtually unaffected by pilin variation, and another is specific for epithelial cells, and is modulated in response to the variation of pilin.	pili	104 108	1	0
1362447	Based on this finding, mutants of a recA- strain were selected that had lost the ability to bind to human cornea epithelial cells (A-) but retained the ability to form pili (P+) and to agglutinate human erythrocytes (H+).	pili	168 172	1	0
1362447	These data demonstrate a central role for PilC in pilus-mediated adherence of N. gonorrhoeae to human epithelial cells and further indicate that neither PilC1 nor PilC2 is obligatory for the assembly of gonococcal pili.	pili	214 218	1	0
1362495	TCR genotypic studies revealed rearranged components (beta plus gamma, or beta alone) in 5/11 cases, but there were no obvious relationships between TCR configuration (including rearranged band densities) and immunophenotypes, absolute lymphocyte or neutrophil numbers, the proportions of blood large granular lymphocyte, or the proportions of CD4+ cells coexpressing CD8.	TCR	0 3	1	0
1362495	The occurrence of identical nk-associated phenotypic profiles in both germline and rearranged TCR cases does, however, suggest the possibility of an evolutionary process from a non-clonal expansion to a clonal state.	TCR	94 97	1	0
1362495	Serum studies, including soluble CD4, CD8 and IL2-R concentrations and autoantibody investigations, of representative germline and rearranged TCR cases failed to indicate any consistent abnormalities, but there was some suggestion for the existence of a chronic reactive process in some of the patients with germline TCR.	TCR	142 145	1	0
1362495	These findings suggest that expanded LGL/NKa+ components with phenotypic evidence of CD4/CD8 coexpression should be regarded as a distinct diagnostic category and that persistent CD4+CD8+ abnormalities with germline TCR should be monitored for possible clonal transition.	TCR	216 219	1	0
1362565	However, when antigen-pulsed splenic antigen-presenting cells are incubated with immune T cells in the presence of anti-LFA-1 monoclonal antibody, selective activation of Th2 cells (as is seen with hepatic APC) again occurs at the expense of activation of Th1 cells.	APC	206 209	0	1
1362912	Histological study revealed that after regeneration for 3 weeks, the total axon number and the fascicular number increased significantly in the fibrin-filled chamber.	axon	75 79	1	0

1363127	Group analysis indicated that enhanced plasma renin activity during therapy was unassociated with diminished antihypertensive effects of an agent as compared with patients in whom RPA showed no increase.	RPA	180 183	0	1
1363702	The findings that CF epithelial cells have increased numbers of receptors for P. aeruginosa attachment and that CF epithelia are less highly sialylated than normal epithelial cells is consistent with a role for Pseudomonas pili in the initial recognition of asialoganglioside receptors on epithelial cells.	pili	223 227	1	0
1363702	Thus, the failure to find the expected sialylated receptor for Pseudomonas attachment may be due to methodologic problems such as studying strains under conditions in which pili are well expressed and affinities for asialylated receptors predominate.	pili	173 177	1	0

1370513	The coreceptor hypothesis postulates that physical association of CD4 with the TCR is required for effective signaling for T cell activation.	TCR	79 82	1	0
1370513	We test the hypothesis of CD4 physical association with the TCR in two different ways.	TCR	60 63	1	0
1370513	First, we use a panel of soluble antibodies directed at different TCR epitopes to activate a cloned T cell line, and show that activation by antibodies directed at a particular TCR epitope can be inhibited by anti-CD4 antibodies binding to a certain CD4 epitope.	TCR	177 180	1	0
1370513	These effects establish that the interaction of CD4 and the TCR occurs in a specific orientation.	TCR	60 63	1	0
1370513	Second, we use the same system to provide evidence that the physical association of CD4 with the TCR is required for effective tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR zeta-chain subunit, presumably reflecting delivery of p56lck (lck) to the TCR.	TCR	97 100	1	0
1370513	Only anti-TCR antibodies that induce physical association of CD4 with the TCR as monitored by cocapping can induce efficient tyrosine-phosphorylation of the TCR zeta-chain, unless second antibodies are used to force CD4 and the TCR to associate.	TCR	74 77	1	0
1370513	We conclude from these studies that stimuli that drive physical association of CD4 and the TCR strongly favor T cell activation, supporting the coreceptor hypothesis of CD4 function.	TCR	91 94	1	0

1371523	To further evaluate the role of the TCR, the vitronectin receptor, and the putative autoantigen in the activation of this T cell subset, we cloned complete cDNA encoding the V gamma 1.1C gamma 4 and V delta 6C delta TCR and transfected the cDNA constructs into a TCR- murine hybridoma and into a TCR- variant of the human Jurkat line.	TCR	36 39	1	0
1371523	The murine transfectant spontaneously produced IL-2 in culture and IL-2 production could be inhibited by anti-CD3, anticlonotypic mAb to the transfected TCR, and anti-vitronectin receptor mAb, as well as by RGDS.	TCR	153 156	1	0
1371523	These results demonstrate that transfection of the gamma delta TCR confers to recipient T cells the phenotype of constitutive activation, as well as dependence on engagement of the vitronectin receptor as an accessory molecule.	TCR	63 66	1	0
1371523	In contrast, the Jurkat gamma delta transfectant failed to produce cytokines spontaneously, although the transfected TCR was capable of signal transduction after stimulation by anti-TCR mAb.	TCR	117 120	1	0
1371523	One interpretation of these results is that coexpression on the surface of the same cell of the V gamma 1.1 V delta 6 TCR, the vitronectin receptor, and a putative autoantigen are necessary for T cell activation in this system.	TCR	118 121	1	0
1371524	Stimulation with either soluble anti-CD3 or anti-alpha/beta TCR mAb rendered cells competent to progress to DNA synthesis in response to exogenous IL-2.	TCR	60 63	1	0
1371525	If the immune response to myelin basic protein peptide 87-106 was homogeneous with respect to epitope specificity and TCR usage, specific immunotherapies targeting the interaction of peptide, MHC, and TCR might be possible.	TCR	118 121	1	0
1371525	Finally, heterogeneity of TCR usage was shown not only for those lines that differed in their peptide specificity but also for some that showed identical responses and were restricted by the same HLA-DR antigen.	TCR	26 29	1	0
1371525	In conclusion, the CD4+ cytotoxic T cell response to the immunodominant myelin basic protein peptide 87-106 demonstrates a high degree of heterogeneity at the level of fine specificity and TCR usage.	TCR	189 192	1	0

1371829	The baseline levels for the MN, sister-chromatid exchange and sperm morphology assays were 1.1-1.4 and 1.2-1.3 MNPCEs/1000 PCEs, 0.23-0.24 and 0.20-0.21 SCEs/chromosome, 3.5-5.7% and 1.6-1.9% abnormal sperm in mice and rats, respectively.	MN	28 30	1	0
1371829	Cyclophosphamide was a potent genotoxin in the MN and sister-chromatid exchange assays but weakly genotoxic in the sperm morphology assay.	MN	47 49	1	0
1371829	At comparable doses, the rat was approximately 3-, 2.5- and 1.8-fold more sensitive to cyclophosphamide than mice in the MN, sperm morphology and sister-chromatid exchange assays, respectively.	MN	121 123	1	0

1387144	Intravenous administration of APC such as splenocytes loaded with a soluble protein Ag has been shown to prime for an Ag-specific CTL response.	APC	30 33	0	1
1387144	It is thought that the APC directly presents loaded Ag in a MHC-restricted manner.	APC	23 26	0	1
1387144	Thus, the syngeneic splenocytes present Ag directly to the T cells, but other membranous vehicles carry the Ag to the host APC including macrophages, which then present it to the T cells.	APC	123 126	0	1
1387145	Thus, there is regulation of TCR expression at a posttranslational level.	TCR	29 32	1	0
1387146	Because the inhibitory activity could be localized to the Th cell itself, it appears that this analog acts by uncoupling a CD4 association (independent of an APC) critical to generating a proliferative response.	APC	158 161	0	1

1388189	Moreover, the signal induced by anti-CD3 antibodies differs from the signal provided by anti-V beta cross-linking of the TCR because both antibodies activate memory CD4 T cells but only anti-CD3 activates naive CD4 T cells.	TCR	121 124	1	0
1388190	Collectively, these studies suggest that the activation requirements of newborn thymic gamma delta T cells differ markedly from alpha beta T cells in that gamma delta T cells 1) respond to combinations of cytokines in the absence of TCR cross-linking, 2) can respond to TCR cross-linking in the presence of exogenous cytokines, 3) but are unable to activate endogenous cytokine production solely in the presence of TCR cross-linking.

1401912	However, the V beta 8.2-39-59 peptide, but not the V beta 8-44-54 peptide, would appear to represent the natural idiotope: antibodies to V beta 8.2-39-59 that develop spontaneously during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis could be boosted to higher titers only by the V beta 8.2-39-59, but not by other TCR peptides from the V beta 8.2 sequence, including V beta 8-44-54 that contains the functional T cell epitope.

1402689	In the presence of Mls-1a determinants, mature CD8+ T cells expressing V beta 6, 8.1, and 9 were deleted in CD4-deficient mice, thus demonstrating that TCR affinity for Mls-1a is sufficient for deletion and that a signal through CD4 was not required.	TCR	152 155	1	0

1403831	It is suggested that the cerebro-olivary projection which transmits the orthodromic responses in the medial accessory olive is indirect, via the superior colliculus, because injection of wheatgerm agglutinin-conjugated peroxidase into the anterior ectosylvian sulcus labelled axon terminals not in the medial accessory olive but in the superior colliculus, and injection of wheatgerm agglutinin-conjugated peroxidase into the medial accessory olive gave rise to retrograde labelling of cells in the superior colliculus.	axon	276 280	1	0

1531460	Recombinant DNA approaches have allowed us to probe the mechanisms by which the regulatory light chains regulate myosin function by identifying the functional importance of specific regions of the RLC molecule.	RLC	197 200	1	0
1531460	For example, we have demonstrated that the presence of high-affinity Ca2+/Mg(2+)-binding site in the N-terminal domain of the RLC is essential for the regulation of myosin-actin interaction [Reinach, F.	RLC	126 129	1	0
1531460	To explore further the role of this metal-binding site in the RLC and generate an RLC with a Ca(2+)-specific site, we constructed four chicken skeletal muscle myosin regulatory light chain hybrid 'genes'.	RLC	62 65	1	0
1531460	In these, the first domain containing the high-affinity Ca2+/Mg(2+)-binding site in the RLC was replaced with that containing the lower-affinity, Ca(2+)-specific, regulatory site from troponin C .	RLC	88 91	1	0
1531460	The results obtained show that the calcium-binding site from troponin c, when transplanted into the RLC backbone, had a low affinity although most of its specificity appeared to be retained.	RLC	100 103	1	0
1531460	These results are in agreement with our previous findings that occupancy of the Ca2+/Mg2+ site in the RLC is essential for regulation.	RLC	102 105	1	0

1531788	In addition, some of these pathogenic autoantibody-inducing t helper clones from the lupus patients had limited diversity and few N-nucleotide additions in their gamma/delta TCR junctional regions (CDR3), thus resembling fetal gamma/delta thymocytes early in ontogeny.	TCR	174 177	1	0
1531842	Exposure of T94, a CD4+ V beta 8-expressing murine Th cell clone, or immediately ex vivo CD4+ T cells to deaggregated, bivalent antibodies specific for either the TCR or CD3 failed to induce an increase in [Ca2+]i, or activation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis unless cross-linked with a secondary anti-Ig antibody.	TCR	163 166	1	0
1531842	We therefore assessed the functional association of CD4 with the TCR/CD3 complex by examining whether a combination of mAb directed against CD4 and CD3 or TCR induced second messenger formation.	TCR	155 158	1	0

1704130	Intrinsic horizontal axon collaterals in the striate cortex of adult cats specifically link columns having the same preferred orientation;	axon	21 25	1	0
1704130	Injections of retrograde tracers in the striate cortex of animals binocularly deprived for greater than 1 month revealed only crude clusters, indicating that horizontal axon collaterals projecting to incorrect orientation columns were retained well past the age when they normally would have been eliminated.	axon	169 173	1	0
1704130	Layer 2/3 pyramidal cells from 6-week-old binocularly deprived animals had abnormal distributions of intrinsic horizontal axon collaterals that mirrored the lack of cluster refinement.	axon	122 126	1	0
1704130	Thus, binocular deprivation did not simply arrest the development of this orientation-specific circuit at an immature state but limited the accuracy with which axon collaterals were added or eliminated.	axon	160 164	1	0

1705316	The results indicate that the bilateral projections from the medial and lateral to the inferior colliculus are mainly established by single medial neurons with axon collaterals to the inferior colliculus on both sides, and by two separate populations of lateral neurons with axons to the contralateral or ipsilateral inferior colliculus.	axon	160 164	1	0

1705561	First, there is a lag between the initiation of axon outgrowth and the phosphorylation of GAP-43 by kinase C.	axon	48 52	1	0
1705561	In some cases, e.g., the trigeminal nerve, our result suggest that kinase C phosphorylation may be correlated with proximity of the growing axon to its target.	axon	140 144	1	0
1705561	Second, kinase C-phosphorylated GAP-43 is always spatially restricted to the distal axon.	axon	84 88	1	0
1705561	Thus, kinase C phosphorylation of GAP-43 is not required for axon outgrowth or growth cone function per se and may be more related to interactions of the growth cone with its environment.	axon	61 65	1	0
1705579	Several nodes along the PNS parts of the alpha-motor axons of the HRP-injected side showed accumulations of AcPase-positive bodies in the constricted nodal axon segment and the adjacent paranodal axoplasm.	axon	156 160	1	0

1709661	We have examined here two hypothetical explanations for this dissociation: 1) It is possible that when interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein is processed in vitro, immunodominant peptide determinants compete with the cryptic ones and inhibit their interaction with the MHC molecules on the APC.	APC	296 299	0	1
1709661	2) The second hypothesis proposes that the cryptic antigenic sites are not generated from interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein by the APC in vitro, whereas enzymes in the retina digest the protein to yield fragments that generate these antigenic sites upon processing by the APC.	APC	141 144	0	1
1709661	Furthermore, experiments with R4 and other cryptic peptides have shown that cleavage fragments of up to 38 residues in length can be presented by APC, to stimulate lymphocytes sensitized against these peptides.	APC	146 149	0	1

1716310	We have examined whether inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme-containing sulfhydryl groups such as, captopril or SQ 14,534, the nonsulfhydryl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, teprotide or enalaprilat and other structurally unrelated sulfhydryl-containing captopril or NAC, N-2-mercaptopropionylglycine or N-acetyl-L-cysteine, could influence platelet aggregation.	NAC	295 298	0	1
1716310	The ability of the thiol-containing captopril or NAC to potentiate the antiaggregatory effects of sodium nitroprusside or iloprost was not associated with an elevation of platelet cyclic GMP or cyclic AMP levels, respectively.	NAC	49 52	0	1

1717647	Because the rate of outgrowth correlated closely with the rate of slow component b in outgrowing sprouts (McQuarrie and Jacob, J. Comp. Neurol. 305:139-147, 1991), we conclude that slow component b is accelerated throughout the length of the axon by 7 days after axotomy.	axon	242 246	1	0

1753215	The regulation of the expression of adipose-related genes, i.e., aP2, adipsin, and glycerophosphate dehydrogenase by growth hormone and polyamines, as well as the role of fatty acids, have been investigated in polyamine-dependent Ob1754 cells and Ob1771 preadipose cells.	aP2	65 68	0	1
1753215	Growth hormone acts as an obligatory hormone for adipsin and glycerophosphate dehydrogenase gene expression but its presence is not required for the expression of the aP2 gene.	aP2	167 170	0	1
1753215	In fully differentiated Ob1771 cells, impairment of fatty acid synthesis by glucose deprivation leads to an inhibition of the aP2 gene expression, whereas the expression of adipsin and glycerophosphate dehydrogenase genes remains unaffected.	aP2	126 129	0	1
1753215	Supplementation of the culture medium with fatty acids prevents the decrease of aP2 gene expression, and this effect appears primarily due to an increase in the transcriptional level of aP2 gene.	aP2	80 83	0	1

1753216	Like fatty acids, dexamethasone provokes a dose-dependent accumulation of aP2 mRNA.	aP2	74 77	0	1
1753216	However, fatty acids and dexamethasone act through different mechanisms to activate the aP2 gene expression since i) fatty acids and dexamethasone act in a synergistic manner;	aP2	88 91	0	1
1753216	Iii) the induction of the aP2 gene expression by dexamethasone does not require ongoing protein synthesis, while the response to fatty acids is completely prevented by cycloheximide;	aP2	26 29	0	1
1753216	And iv) the induction of the aP2 gene expression by fatty acids but not by dexamethasone is confined to preadipocyte cell lines.	aP2	29 32	0	1
1753216	This suggests that the process of activation by fatty acids, rather than the expression of the aP2 gene, is unique to adipose cells.	aP2	95 98	0	1
1753216	Besides their effects on the aP2 gene, fatty acids activate the expression of the acyl CoA synthetase gene which encodes another protein involved in fatty acid metabolism.	aP2	29 32	0	1
1753216	Activation of both genes by fatty acids appears not to be mediated by the CCAAT enhancer binding protein, a nuclear factor reported as transactivator of the aP2 promoter activity, since the enhancer binding protein mRNA is not expressed under these conditions.	aP2	157 160	0	1

1825105	However, apparently inconsistent with such an hypothesis, we found that the frequency of double negative thymocytes expressing various anti-self TCR (V beta 6, V beta 8.1, V beta 11, V beta 17a) were not increased in strains expressing their putative self-Ag, but instead were either unaffected or significantly reduced in those strains.	TCR	145 148	1	0
1825105	Even though V beta 8 overexpression appeared to be generated by a mechanism distinct from that generating the rest of the double negative TCR-alpha beta + thymocyte repertoire, we found that super-Ag against which V beta 8 TCR react introduced into the neonatal differentiation environment also significantly reduced, rather than increased, the frequency of double negative TCR-alpha beta + V beta 8+ thymocytes.	TCR	223 226	1	0
1825105	Thus, the present study is consistent with double negative TCR-alpha beta + thymocytes being mature cells derived from CD8+ precursors, and documents that their TCR repertoire can be influenced, at least negatively, by either self-Ag or Ag introduced into the neonatal differentiation environment.

1826700	In order to test whether limitation of this signaling pathway by TCR number may be relevant to signal transduction in the wild-type cell, we compared PLC activity in Jurkat cells during soluble anti-CD3 mAb-induced internalization of the TCR and also in response to immobilized mAb.	PLC	150 153	0	1
1826700	The net accumulation of inositol phosphates per min decreased linearly with TCR number during the rapid phase of TCR internalization, confirming the limiting role of TCR number in this system.	TCR	76 79	1	0
1826700	In a Jurkat cell line transfected with the heterologous human muscarinic receptor, subtype 1, the inositol phosphates response to a muscarinic agonist was unaffected by TCR internalization, indicating that the distal phosphatidylinositol pathway was not affected by prolonged stimulation of the TCR.

1826700	We conclude that transmembrane signaling through the TCR may be regulated by the number of surface TCR-ligand complexes.	TCR	53 56	1	0
1826701	Despite the tremendous plasticity of the TCR repertoire, T cells recognize a limited number of antigenic sites (frequently a single site, or immunodominant epitope) on a complex protein Ag.	TCR	41 44	1	0
1826701	The role of specific TCR alpha- or beta-chains in determining MHC restriction and recognizing specific epitopes is complex and incompletely understood.	TCR	21 24	1	0
1826701	To evaluate the contribution of each TCR chain to the functional diversity of the T cell repertoire, we investigated in vivo the T cell response to phage lambda-repressor protein in transgenic mice expressing a single rearranged beta-chain gene (C57L beta mice) in association with the complete germline alpha-chain repertoire.	TCR	37 40	1	0
1826701	These data indicate that the primary site, or immunodominant epitope, of an Ag recognized by T cells can be altered by the preimmune TCR repertoire independent of antigen processing and MHC affinity.	TCR	133 136	1	0
1826863	The expression of TCR by T cells that mature extrathymically in nude mice was determined by staining Ig- cells from B10 nude mice that were 5 months of age or older with mAbs specific for CD3, alpha/beta or gamma/delta TCR.	TCR	18 21	1	0
1826863	Although the majority of Ig- cells in older nude mice express TCR, the distribution of alpha/beta and gamma/delta TCR in relation to CD4 and CD8 expression is markedly different compared to T cells from euthymic mice.	TCR	62 65	1	0
1826863	Approximately half of the CD3+ T cells found in the spleen and lymph nodes of nude mice express gamma/delta TCR that is equally distributed between CD4-8- double-negative and CD8+ single-positive T cells.	TCR	108 111	1	0
1826863	These data provide the first quantitative measure of the expression of TCR by T cells that mature in the absence of a thymus and suggest that the extrathymic environment, although not efficient, is permissive for the maturation of T cells that express alpha/beta and gamma/delta TCR.	TCR	71 74	1	0
1826885	Previously we have shown that a small fraction of human peripheral T cells expresses a surface receptor recognized both by the BMA031 mAb, specific for a TcR alpha/beta framework epitope, and by the A13 mAb, putatively specific for an epitope encoded by the V delta 1 gene segment.	TcR	154 157	1	0
1826885	The molecular characterization of the TcR chains expressed by T2 cells demonstrated indeed that the V delta 1 gene (one of the two major V delta genes) was transcribed with the C alpha gene segment.	TcR	38 41	1	0
1826885	In the T2 polyclonal cell line, distinct V delta 1/C alpha transcripts were all found to include the same J alpha segment suggesting the existence of "hybrid" TcR alpha/delta chains encoded by unique V delta 1/J alpha rearrangements.	TcR	159 162	1	0

1827351	SR preincubated with anti-glycoprotein antiserum (which causes an uncoupling of Ca2+ transport from ATP hydrolysis) or SR extracted with cholate in 1 M KCl (yielding membranes depleted of GP-53) displays decreased positive cooperative dependence on [Ca2+] and decreased negative cooperative dependence on [ATP].

1827815	BALB/c but not nonobese diabetic thymic T cells respond to Con A in the presence of either BALB/c or nonobese diabetic thymic APC, suggesting that the thymic T cell defect in nonobese diabetic mice is intrinsic to nonobese diabetic thymic T cells and is not due to an inability of nonobese diabetic APC to provide a costimulatory signal.

1834734	APC do not distinguish between self- and foreign proteins.	APC	0 3	0	1
1834734	Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that most endogenous host APC constitutively processed and presented the self-Ag, hemoglobin, as detected by the Hb-specific T cell hybridoma, YO1.6.	APC	76 79	0	1
1834734	We have now examined APC in organs known to be involved in RBC degradation (liver Kupffer cells and splenic small resting B cells) for the presence of Hb/Ia complexes and for the expression of the costimulation necessary to trigger proliferation of T cell clones.	APC	21 24	0	1
1834734	In this report we have demonstrated that 1) endogenously formed self Hb/Ia complexes are expressed on splenic small resting B cells and liver Kupffer cells but not on lymph node small resting B cells and 2) these APC are also able to limit the expression of costimulatory activity for Th2 and Th1 T cell clones.	APC	213 216	0	1
1834734	Thus, endogenous APC not only constitutively process and present the self-Ag hemoglobin, but also limit expression of the costimulatory activity necessary to trigger T cell proliferation against a self-Ag.	APC	17 20	0	1
1834734	The constitutive processing and presentation of self-Ag, as well as the regulation of costimulatory activity on APC, is likely an important feature of the maintenance of self-tolerance.	APC	112 115	0	1
1834737	The proliferative responses of the cloned cells were class I restricted, as demonstrated by reconstitution of the cloned T cells with APC matched at various MHC class I and II loci, as well as by inhibition with anti-class I and not anti-class II mAb.	APC	134 137	0	1

1834739	Our observations suggest that synergistic signaling provided as a consequence of CD4 or CD8 association with the TCR after antigenic stimulation may develop on a different temporal scale than that observed after soluble anti-CD4+ anti-CD3 heteroconjugate antibody cross-linking.

1834760	As these epithelial cells are in close contact with intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes that are nearly all CD8+, and many of which express the gamma delta TCR, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that thymus leukemia antigen is involved in antigen presentation, perhaps to gamma delta-positive lymphocytes in this site.

1835090	Consequently, it has been proposed that TCR alpha beta has a conformation similar to that of an immunoglobulin Fab fragment and that the regions of the TCR homologous to the three immunoglobulin complementarity-determining regions (CDRs 1, 2, and 3) bind to the peptide antigen-major histocompatibility complex molecule ligand.

APC	295 298	0	1
1836477	This hyporesponsiveness was: specific for the allohaplotype of inducing APC, maintained for 96 h in vitro, not due to cellular inhibitory mechanisms, and associated with reduced ability to secrete IL-2 but not IL-3.	APC	72 75	0	1
1836477	Induction of this hyporesponsiveness was not due to altered expression of class II MHC gene products on the APC but was associated with markedly reduced T lymphocyte-APC adhesive interactions despite the lack of a detectable immunophenotypic change in lymphocyte function-associated Ag 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression on the modified APC.	APC	108 111	0	1
1836477	Therefore, we propose that TCR occupancy in the absence of normal T lymphocyte-APC adhesive clustering may induce T lymphocyte tolerance.	TCR	27 30	0	1

1854030	Desflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia decreased systemic blood pressures, cardiac index, stroke volume index, systemic vascular resistance, and left ventricular stroke work index, and increased pulmonary arterial pressures and central venous pressure in a dose-dependent fashion, while heart rate was 10%-12% and mixed venous oxygen tension was 2-4 mm Hg higher at all MAC levels than at baseline (awake).	MAC	367 370	0	1
1854030	At approximately comparable MAC levels, heart rate was lower and systemic blood pressures, central venous pressure, left ventricular stroke work index, and systemic vascular resistance usually were significantly higher during anesthesia with desflurane and nitrous oxide than during desflurane anesthesia alone (same volunteers, data collected in crossover design).	MAC	28 31	0	1
1854032	We asked if desflurane with or without nitrous oxide at 0.83, 1.24, and 1.66 MAC prevented cardiovascular responses to stimulation.	MAC	77 80	0	1
1854032	At 0.83 and 1.24 MAC, cardiac output, mean systemic arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and pulmonary arterial blood pressure increased.	MAC	17 20	0	1
1854032	At 1.66 MAC, heart rate and systemic blood pressure responses were attenuated, but this level of anesthesia had equivocal effects on the cardiac output and pulmonary blood pressure responses.	MAC	8 11	0	1

1928874	INTERVENTIONS: IV NAC treatment consisted of a loading dose of 140 mg/kg followed by 12 doses of 70 mg/kg every four hours.	NAC	18 21	0	1
1928874	Hepatotoxicity (aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase of more than 1,000 IU/L) developed in 10% (five of 50) of patients at "probable risk" when IV NAC was started within ten hours of acetaminophen ingestion and in 27.1% (23 of 85) when therapy was begun after ten to 24 hours.

1929873	The tissue response in tracheobronchial lymph nodes during 60-270 days post-instillation of PVC dust was characterized by progressive increase in total organ fresh weight, dry weight, DNA, RNA and protein contents, concurrent with the proliferation of macrophages and hyperplasia of reticular cells.	PVC	92 95	0	1
1929873	PVC dust caused degeneration of macrophages, and consequent release of hydrolytic enzymes resulted in limited cytotoxicity without inducing reticulination and fibrosis in the tracheobronchial lymph nodes.	PVC	0 3	0	1

1930847	The results obtained with these various agonists tested under the same experimental conditions confirm that the classical pathogenic diagram: (PLC hyperactivation----increase in c-fos transcription----enhanced cell proliferation) may apply to the action of vasoactive agents which are only slightly mitogenic on spontaneously hypertensive rats cells, but not to the very important effect of fetal calf serum.	PLC	143 146	0	1
1930847	An abnormal molecular reaction different from PLC activation is therefore responsible for the enhanced proliferation of cultured spontaneously hypertensive rats aortic smooth muscle cells, and several cell alterations may concur to the formation of the hypertensive arteriopathy.

1939181	The increase in IMP pool levels may result from (i) a direct inhibitory effect of ribavirin 5'-monophosphate on IMP dehydrogenase (which converts IMP to XMP) and (ii) an indirect inhibition of adenylosuccinate synthetase by the decreased GTP and dGTP pools (since GTP is an obligatory cofactor in the conversion of IMP to succinyl AMP).

1971014	In the cerebellum, taurine-like immunoreactivity was present in both basket cell axon terminals which formed symmetric synapses with Purkinje cell neurons, and in a few mossy fiber terminals which formed asymmetric synapses with dendritic spines.	axon	81 85	1	0

1971181	Type 1 pili, but not P or Pseudomonas pili, markedly increased bacterial adherence.	pili	7 11	1	0
1971181	The adherence-promoting effect of Type 1 pili was due to the mannose-binding Type 1 pili adhesin, as both alpha-methyl mannoside and concanavalin A blocked adherence of Type 1 piliated bacteria.	pili	41 45	1	0

1971257	The hemagglutinating activity of the purified pili was inhibited by the Fab fraction of antipilus antibody, but the hemagglutinating activity of live organisms was not inhibited completely.	pili	46 50	1	0
1971257	The purified pili or Fab fraction of antipilus antibody did not inhibit the adhesion of V. cholerae non-O1 to rabbit intestines.	pili	13 17	1	0

1971292	We report a methodology for selecting APC with mutations that have impaired their ability to present Ag to T cells.	APC	38 41	0	1
1971292	During these cocultures, the T-T hybridomas kill the competent APC, allowing the outgrowth of inactive variants.	APC	63 66	0	1
1971292	This defect is also observed for the presentation of processing independent peptides by fixed APC indicating that a lesion exists in a post-Ag processing step.	APC	94 97	0	1
1971292	The level of expression of MHC molecules is unaffected and the functional defect in the APC is not localized to a particular MHC molecule.	APC	88 91	0	1
1971292	Similarly, anti-LFA-1 mAb inhibited the response of T cells to Ag presented by the wild-type A20 to a much greater degree than by the mutant cells, indicating that LFA-1 is involved in interaction of T cells with the former, but not latter, APC.	APC	241 244	0	1
1971292	In the apparent absence of a contribution of LFA-1 to the T cell-APC interaction, either as a result of mAb blocking or the disruption of the APC membrane, the mutant and wild-type APC have a similar level of Ag-presenting activity.	APC	142 145	0	1
1971292	Finally, these results also demonstrate the feasibility of selecting APC with mutations affecting Ag presentation.	APC	69 72	0	1

1971295	The analysis of P40 genomic clones reported here shows that the human and mouse P40 genes consist of 5 exons spread over approximately 4 kb of DNA and organized in a similar fashion in both species.	P40	16 19	1	0
1971295	Expression of human P40 was studied in PBMC.	P40	20 23	1	0
1971295	Treatment of the cells with PMA and a calcium ionophore induced strong expression of a 0.7-kb P40 mRNA.	P40	94 97	1	0
1971295	No message was detected in unstimulated cells or in cells stimulated with LPS or Staphylococcus aureus, indicating that P40 expression is not constitutive and suggesting that the gene is not easily activated in B lymphocytes and in monocytes.	P40	120 123	1	0
1971295	By contrast, T cell mitogens such as PHA or anti-CD3 antibodies induced a substantial P40 expression that was further enhanced in the presence of PMA.	P40	86 89	1	0
1971295	The induction of P40 by anti-CD3 antibodies suggests that P40 production is part of the normal T cell response to antigenic stimulation.	P40	17 20	1	0

1971705	Aeromonas hydrophila (Ae6) has 2 morphologically distinctive kinds of pili.	pili	70 74	1	0
1971705	One appeared rigid, channeled, and straight with a diameter of 9 nm (Ae6-R pili).	pili	75 79	1	0
1971705	The other looked flexible, wavy, and having helical structure with a diameter of 7 nm (Ae6-W pili).	pili	93 97	1	0
1971705	Ae6-R pili were purified and characterized.	pili	6 10	1	0
1971705	The pili consisted of a subunit protein with a molecular weight of 18 kDa as estimated by SDS-PAGE, and contained 42.3% hydrophobic amino acids and one cysteine residue.	pili	4 8	1	0
1971705	Purified Ae6-R pili did not adhere to the intestine or to the erythrocytes.	pili	15 19	1	0
1971705	From these results, Ae6-R pili are not likely a colonization factor but probably play a role in the autoaggregation of the organisms.	pili	26 30	1	0
1971829	All three clones produced IFN-gamma and IL-2 in varying amounts upon antigenic stimulation in the presence of irradiated APC.	APC	121 124	0	1

1972159	Of six xenogeneic responses evaluated, only the human antimurine response was dependent on human APC for CTL generation.	APC	97 100	0	1
1972159	APC requirements for the other five xenogeneic responses more closely resembled those observed in the generation of human or murine alloreactive CTL.	APC	0 3	0	1
1972159	Effective presentation of murine stimulator Ag by human APC was completely blocked by anti-human Ia mAb, indicating that the Ag is presented to Th cells via the human class II molecule.	APC	56 59	0	1
1972160	Functional studies demonstrate that T cell activation often requires not only occupancy of the TCR but costimulatory interactions of other molecules, which remain largely undefined.	TCR	95 98	1	0
1972160	We have tested the hypothesis that LFA-1 interaction with its ligand intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (CD54) (ICAM-1) is such a costimulatory interaction in a model system using biochemically purified ICAM-1 and TCR cross-linking by anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 immobilized on plastic.	TCR	213 216	1	0
1972164	Secretion of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma was determined after specific stimulation of these t lymphocyte clones, using autologous monocytes as APC.	APC	141 144	0	1
1972164	These lymphokine profiles were consistent for at least 3 days and were neither dependent on the dose of allergen nor on the atopic or nonatopic state of the donor of APC.	APC	166 169	0	1
1972173	The overwhelming majority of dendritic epidermal t cells are an unusually homogeneous population of thymic-dependent cells which express CD3-associated T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs) of the gamma/delta type, thereby distinguishing them from conventional CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+ T cells expressing CD3-associated alpha/beta TCR.	TCR	321 324	1	0
1972173	Like the TCR on other populations of gamma/delta cells, which preferentially populate other epithelia such as in the gut and lung, the TCR on most dendritic epidermal t cells selectively utilize particular variable (V) gene segments (i.e., V gamma 3 and V delta 1 for dendritic epidermal t cells vs V gamma 5 and V delta 4 or V delta 6 for intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes).	TCR	9 12	1	0
1972173	However, unlike other gamma/delta populations whose TCR junctional regions exhibit marked heterogeneity, dendritic epidermal t cells junctional diversity is extremely limited.	TCR	52 55	1	0
1972173	This lack of TCR heterogeneity among dendritic epidermal t cells suggests they recognize a narrow range of physiologic ligands (antigens) and that this recognition is restricted not by conventional polymorphic class-I or class-II MHC molecules, but rather by relatively nonpolymorphic self MHC-like molecules of the class Ib MHC type [e.g., Qa, TL, and CD1 (T6)].	TCR	13 16	1	0
1972176	Transmembrane signaling of normal human T cells was explored with mAbs directed at TCR, CD2, CD4, CD5, or CD8 antigens and highly purified CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells.	TCR	83 86	1	0
1972176	Our experiments explicitly show that: (a) crosslinkage of TCR with the CD2 antigen, and not independent crosslinking of TCR and of CD2 antigen or crosslinking of either protein with the CD4 or CD8 antigen induces significant proliferation independent of co-stimulatory signals (e.g., accessory cells, recombinant lymphokines, or tumor promoter), (b) F(ab')2 fragments of mAb directed at the TCR and F(ab')2 anti-CD2, crosslinked with F(ab')2 fragments of rabbit anti-mouse IgG, promote the proliferation of highly purified T cells, (c) a prompt and sustained increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration results from crosslinkage of TCR with the CD2 antigen, (d) T cell proliferation induced by this novel approach is curtailed by EGTA and by direct or competitive inhibitors of PKC, (e) crosslinkage of TCR with the CD2 antigen results in the transcriptional activation and translation of the gene for IL-2 and in the expression of IL-2 receptor alpha (CD25), (f) anti-CD25 mAbs inhibit T cell proliferation initiated by crosslinkage of TCR with the CD2 antigen, and recombinant IL-2 restores the proliferative response.	TCR	58 61	1	0
1972176	Our first demonstration that crosslinkage of TCR with the CD2 antigen induces proliferation of normal human CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, in addition to revealing a novel activation mechanism utilizable by the two major subsets of T cells, suggest that the CD2 antigen might be targeted for the regulation of antigen-specific T cell immunity (e.g., organ transplantation).	TCR	45 48	1	0
1972177	The presence of variant CD4+ T cells was demonstrated by isolating and cloning them from peripheral blood, and their abnormalities can be accounted for by alterations in TCR expression such as defects of protein expression and partial protein deletion.	TCR	170 173	1	0
1972177	These findings suggest that such alterations in TCR expression are induced by somatic mutagenesis of TCR genes and can be important factors related to age-dependent and genetic disease-associated T cell dysfunction.	TCR	48 51	1	0

1972719	MHC-restricted T cells typically recognize soluble Ag subsequent to modification by an APC, and APC may ultimately express a processed form of the Ag that is different from that expressed on the surface of the tumor cells.	APC	87 90	0	1
1972729	Thus, helper function is associated with intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and PLC activation, while cytolysis can occur even in the absence of detectable levels of these second messengers.	PLC	77 80	0	1
1973169	Since the structural organization of auxilin does not resemble that of the ubiquitous heterotetrameric HA1 and HA2 adaptor complexes, that are believed to connect clathrin to receptors, it is unlikely that it functions as an adaptor.	HA2	111 114	1	0
1973181	In the process of generating culture supernatant from T cell clones, with anti-CD3 antibodies and the B lymphoma A20 as APC, a striking difference in the stimulation of TH1 and TH2 clones was observed, i.e., TH2 clones produced higher levels of lymphokines than TH1 clones.	APC	120 123	0	1
1973181	This prompted us to test the hypothesis that differential killing of APC (thus the removal of stimuli) by T cells led to differential T cell activation.	APC	69 72	0	1
1973181	High levels of killing of APC led to low levels of T cell activation, the significance of which may be as a negative feedback mechanism in the immune response.	APC	26 29	0	1
1973182	In order to evaluate the relationship between these cell types, we made a series of new Ts1 hybridomas by the fusion of Ts1 cells with the functionally TCR alpha/beta-negative BW thymoma (BW 1100).	TCR	152 155	1	0
1973182	Three Ts1 hybridomas (CKB-Ts1-38, CKB-Ts1-53, and CKB-Ts1-81) were established that express TCR and produce Ag-specific suppressor factors constitutively, thus making it possible to study the nature and specificity of Ag receptors, MHC restriction, and lymphokine production by the Ts1 hybridomas.

1975827	Together with evidence that host alloantigen-induced lymphokine secretion was 10 to 100 times lower than the anti-CD3 response, these data suggest that physiologic lymphokine synthesis by most T cells is low (less than 10(-18) mol of IL-3 per cell) but can be raised above the threshold of detection by TCR cross-linking.

1983996	Thirty minutes after glucose-induced recovery, the PDHC activity had decreased by 33% compared to control levels, and remained significantly depressed after 3 h of recovery.	PDHC	51 55	1	0
1983996	This decrease in activity was not due to a decrease in the total PDHC activity.	PDHC	65 69	1	0
1983996	At 24 h of recovery, PDHC activity had returned to control levels.	PDHC	21 25	1	0
1983996	We conclude that the activation of PDHC during hypoglycemic coma is probably the result of an increased PDH phosphatase activity following depolarization and calcium influx, and allosteric inhibition of PDH kinase due to increased ADP/ATP ratio.	PDHC	35 39	1	0
1983996	The depression of PDHC activity following hypoglycemic coma is probably due to an increased phosphorylation of the enzyme, as a consequence of an imbalance between PDH phosphatase and kinase activities.	PDHC	18 22	1	0
1983996	Since some reduction of the ATP/ADP ratio persisted and since the lactate/pyruvate ratio had normalized by 3 h of recovery, the depression of PDHC most likely reflects a decrease in PDH phosphatase activity, probably due to a decrease in intramitochondrial Ca2+.	PDHC	142 146	1	0

1993658	Recently, we showed that a highly purified cap-binding protein complex composed of the p220 and p28 subunits of eukaryotic initiation factor 4F, in a 1:1 molar ratio, restores protein synthesis in these cell-free translation systems (Lamphear, B.J., and Panniers, R. (1990) J.	p28	96 99	0	1
1993658	However we cannot distinguish between two possible explanations: (i) reduced association of p220 with p28 or (ii) a non-competitive inhibitor blocks complex binding to cap.	p28	102 105	0	1

1993687	Treatment of cells with epidermal growth factor resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of both p28 (eIF-4E) and p220 subunits.	p28	93 96	0	1
1993687	The identities of the p28 and p220 subunits were confirmed by immunoprecipitation.	p28	22 25	0	1
1993687	P28 attained maximal levels (2-3-fold) within 30 min of treatment and remained elevated for at least 2 h, while p220 reached one-half maximal levels by 30 min, and maximal levels (3-4-fold) by 2 h of treatment.	P28	0 3	0	1
1993687	Two phosphorylated isoforms of p28 and multiple phosphorylated forms of p220 were detected by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.	p28	31 34	0	1
1993687	Phosphoamino acid analysis of 6 N HCl hydrolyzates of p28 and p220 isolated from epidermal growth factor-treated and control cells indicated that serine is the predominant phosphorylated amino acid in both instances.	p28	54 57	0	1

1993850	Moreover, the failure of Sephadex G10-passed spleen cells to deliver anti-CSA1M resistance demonstrated the absolute requirement of APC for inducing the in vivo immunity.	APC	132 135	0	1
1993850	Finally, this in vivo resistance was found to be tumor specific, because APC fractions from CSA1M-bearing and Meth A-bearing BALB/c mice induced immune resistance selective against the corresponding tumor cell challenge.	APC	73 76	0	1
1993850	These results indicate that APC from tumor-bearing hosts can not only exert unaffected APC function against exogenous Ag, but also function to present tumor Ag generated endogenously in the tumor-bearing state and to produce tumor-specific immunity in vivo.	APC	28 31	0	1

1998887	Since fibre diameter comprises axon diameter plus the thickness of its surrounding myelin sheath, a reduction in mean fibre diameter from 1.52 microns in normals to 1.20 microns in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis was expected, but it was surprising to find that a mean g ratio of 0.85 obtained for normal nerves was not substantially different from a value of 0.86 for demyelinated optic nerves.	axon	31 35	1	0
1998887	A decrease in the mean axon diameter of 1.24 microns for normal animals to 0.94 microns for those with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis tended to offset the decrease in mean myelin sheath thickness and contributed to the relative stability of the g ratio with acute demyelination.	axon	23 27	1	0

2058677	Therefore, we undertook a careful comparison of two methods of intestinal epithelial cell isolation, the distended intestinal sac method and the everted intestinal sac method.	sac	126 129	0	1
2058677	The isolated cell fractions (distended sac fractions 1-10, everted sac fractions 1-5) were evaluated for the expression of two mRNAs whose localization along the crypt-villus axis had been previously elucidated by in situ hybridization: cytochrome P-450IIB1 (expressed in villus cells) and cryptdin (expressed in crypt cells).	sac	39 42	0	1
2058677	Cryptdin mRNA was detected only in cell fractions 5-10 using the distended sac method and was not detected in any fractions from the everted sac method.	sac	75 78	0	1
2058677	[3H]thymidine incorporation demonstrated that dividing (crypt) cells were successfully removed by the distended sac method, but remained with the everted sac intestinal remnant.	sac	112 115	0	1
2058677	Finally, light and electron microscopy of the isolated cells as well as the intestinal remnants confirmed that while undifferentiated crypt cells were present in distended sac cell fractions 9 and 10, they remained with the everted sac remnant.	sac	172 175	0	1
2058677	Thus the distended sac protocol was useful for the isolation of cells from tip and crypt compartments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	sac	19 22	0	1
2058825	METHODS: Twelve patients (K1: ASA class I-II, age: 39.9 +/- 16.1 years, height: 176 +/- 10.1 cm, weight: 76 +/- 12.8 kg) scheduled for urological lower abdominal surgery were given isoflurane-N2O-O2 (1.3 MAC);	MAC	204 207	0	1
2058894	The effects of some fluorinated anesthetics and convulsants on the ionic conductances of the axon membrane of the squid Loligo forbesi are described.	axon	93 97	1	0
2059569	We have produced and characterized a monoclonal antibody, AT101, which selectively labels both viable and formaldehyde-fixed horizontal cell axon terminals, but not their somas or axons, of the goldfish (Carassius auratus) retina.	axon	141 145	1	0
2059569	We have used AT101 as a probe to analyze immunocytochemically the organization of horizontal cell axon terminals in the adult goldfish retina, and the emergence and maturation of these terminals during retinal development.	axon	98 102	1	0
2059569	In the center and near periphery of the adult retina, horizontal cell axon terminals have a fusiform morphology and form a dense network in the middle and proximal part of the inner nuclear layer.	axon	70 74	1	0
2059569	In the far peripheral retina, the axon terminals appear round or ellipsoid.	axon	34 38	1	0
2059569	The retina closest to the retinal margin is devoid of AT101 staining, indicating that either horizontal cell axon terminals are absent or the antigen recognized by AT101 is not present on horizontal cell axon terminals at this stage.	axon	109 113	1	0
2059569	Double-labeling experiments with AT101 and antiserum against tubulin also indicate that AT101 labels the horizontal cell axon terminals when they first appear during development.	axon	121 125	1	0
2059810	Our method of treatment has evolved from our previous approach of controlled open lesser sac drainage (marsupialization) to staged necrosectomy/debridement with delayed primary closure over drains.	sac	89 92	0	1

2061308	Stoichiometry studies with [7-14C]phenylglyoxal showed that only 1 reactive arginine residue was modified by the chemical reagent and that this arginine residue could be shielded by GTP and IMP.	IMP	190 193	0	1
2061308	The mutant enzyme (R147L) showed increased Michaelis constants for IMP and GTP relative to the wild-type system, whereas the Km for aspartate exhibited a modest decrease as compared with the native enzyme.	IMP	67 70	0	1
2061475	Twenty spinal studies to rule out cord compression using a multicoil array system were compared with the 20 consecutive previous studies in which a 5 x 11 inch flat plate coil (5 x 11 FPC) was used on the same 1.5 T MR scanner.	FPC	184 187	0	1
2061475	The multicoil studies averaged 53 min shorter overall (105 min with the 5 x 11 FPC versus 52 min with multicoil).	FPC	79 82	0	1
